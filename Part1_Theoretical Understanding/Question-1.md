Algorithmic bias refers to systematic and unfair discrimination that occurs when an AI system produces outcomes that favor or disadvantage certain individuals or groups. This bias can arise from skewed training data, flawed model design, or biased human assumptions embedded in the algorithm.

Examples of how algorithmic bias manifests:

Biased Hiring Systems
An AI recruitment tool may unfairly penalize female applicants because it was trained on historical hiring data dominated by male candidates. As a result, the model learns to prioritize resumes containing male-associated terms or job histories.

Facial Recognition Bias
Some facial recognition systems misidentify people of darker skin tones at significantly higher rates. This often occurs because the training datasets contain more images of lighter-skinned individuals, leading the model to perform poorly on underrepresented groups.
